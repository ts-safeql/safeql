# Testing Rules

When running tests in this project, you must follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the package directory**: `cd` into the specific package directory where the test is located (e.g., `cd packages/eslint-plugin`).
2. **Run the test using pnpm and vitest**: Use the following command format:
   ```bash
   pnpm vitest run [filename] -t "[testname]"
   ```

Replace `[filename]` with the path to the test file relative to the package root (e.g., `src/rules/check-sql.test.ts`), and `[testname]` with the specific test name or a pattern matching the test name you want to run.

## Guidelines
- Always `cd` to the package root before running `pnpm vitest`.
- Use the `run` command for a single execution.
- Use the `-t` flag to isolate specific tests, especially in large test files.

## Example

To run a specific test in `packages/eslint-plugin/src/rules/check-sql.test.ts`:

```bash
cd packages/eslint-plugin
pnpm vitest run src/rules/check-sql.test.ts -t "my test name"
```
